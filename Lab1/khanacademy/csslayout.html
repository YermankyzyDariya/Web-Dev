        <div id="info">
        <p>The cat (Felis catus), also called domestic cat and house cat, 
            is a small carnivorous mammal. It is an obligate carnivore, 
            requiring a predominantly meat-based diet. Its retractable 
            claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. 
            It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and 
            its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. 
            It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular 
            predator. Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, 
            hissing, growling, grunting, and body language. It can hear sounds 
            too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those
             made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
            Cat intelligence is evident in its ability to adapt, learn 
              through observation, and solve problems. Female domestic cats can 
              have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout 
              the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging 
              from two to five kittens.</p>
        <p>
            The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, 
            is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was 
            first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The 
            Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African 
            language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' 
            and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[6]
