        <h2 id="rabit-head"> Basic info </h2>
        <p class="song-lyrics">rabbits, or bunnies, are small mammals in the 
            family Leporidae (which also includes the hares), which is in the order 
            Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). They are familiar throughout the world as a small 
            herbivore, a prey animal, a domesticated form of livestock, and a pet, having a 
            widespread effect on ecologies and cultures. The most widespread rabbit genera are 
            Oryctolagus and Sylvilagus. <strong>The former, Oryctolagus, includes the European rabbit, 
            Oryctolagus cuniculus, which is the ancestor of the hundreds of breeds of domestic 
            rabbit and has been introduced on every continent <em>except</em> Antarctica</strong>.</p>
        <p class="song-lyrics">
            Wild rabbits not included in Oryctolagus <br>
            and Sylvilagus include several species <br>
            of limited distribution, including the <br>
            pygmy <em>rabbit</em>, volcano rabbit, and Sumatran <br>
            striped rabbit.<br>
